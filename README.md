# ♞ Knight Travails

A visual pathfinding project built in Python that demonstrates how a knight moves across a chessboard using the shortest possible path. Inspired by **The Odin Project**, this project implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and provides a GUI visualization of the knight's journey from start to target position.
