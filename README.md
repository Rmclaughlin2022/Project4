# ♞ Portfolio Project
A project that I can add on other games into in order to show them off. 

This sign-in page inspired by Norse mythology, created for "The Odin Project." It includes validation on the login button and uses carefully selected images to enhance the aesthetic.

For Knights Travails there is visual pathfinding project built in javascript that demonstrates how a knight moves across a chessboard using the shortest possible path. Inspired by **The Odin Project**, this project implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and provides a GUI visualization of the knight's journey from start to target position.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

## Sign-In Page
- Text fields for user input
- Login button with validation
- Background images and styling inspired by Norse mythology
- Responsive layout using grids and flexbox

### Knight Travails
- Calculates shortest path between two squares on a chessboard
- Uses a valid knight’s movement
- Implements a Breadth-First Search algorithm
- Shows full move history from start to end

### ✨ Additional Features
- Graphical user interface to visualize knight's path
- Customizable board size
- Step-by-step move display using Matplotlib animation
- Added a Game Home to go to different Pages so I can add in more projects in the future

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rmclaughlin2022/Project4.git

## 🌱 Future Improvements
- Making things look a little bit better and adding more projects like stockfish
- Animate knight movement step-by-step
- Add support for obstacles on the board

## 📚 What I Learned

- Implementing BFS in a real-world context
- Designing a simple but functional GUI 
- Object-oriented design principles for organizing code
- How to visualize algorithms for better understanding
